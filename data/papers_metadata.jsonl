To address these limitations, we propose the first multi-graph joint\nreasoning benchmark for VLMs. Our benchmark encompasses four graph categories:\nknowledge graphs, flowcharts, mind maps, and route maps,with each graph group\naccompanied by three progressively challenging instruction-response pairs.\nLeveraging this benchmark, we conducted comprehensive capability assessments of\nstate-of-the-art VLMs and performed fine-tuning on open-source models. This\nstudy not only addresses the underexplored evaluation gap in multi-graph\nreasoning for VLMs but also empirically validates their generalization\nsuperiority in graph-structured learning.", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21435v1", "topic": "artificial intelligence", "published": "2025-03-27T12:20:37+00:00", "arxiv_id": "2503.21435v1"}

While recent attempts have adapted\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into\ngenerators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor\nquality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at\novercoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as\nProgressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D\nground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a\nnative 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to\nprogressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each\nstep it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion\nmodels, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill\ntext-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score\ndistillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can\neasily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for\nchallenging text prompts with creative concepts.

Nevertheless, the applicability of the\nQUAPI method to realistic systems of interest is restricted by the\nexponentially growing computer memory requirements with respect to the size of\nthe quantum system and the time range of non-Markovian correlation effects.\nThis exponential ''wall'' becomes even more severe for multiple non-commuting\nfluctuating environments. In the present work, we address the numerical\nefficiency and accuracy of approximations that have been introduced for the\nQUAPI method with a single general environment, for the case of two independent\nnon-commuting environments where one of them is considered as a pure dephasing\nenvironment. Specifically, we consider a sharply defined cut-off of the memory\ntime, path filtering and mask assisted coarse graining of influence functional\ncoefficients (MACGIC-QUAPI) as approximations. We demonstrate that commonly\napplied numerical techniques such as path filtering cannot be straightforwardly\ntransferred to the two bath case even in the weak-coupling and quasi-Markovian\nlimits. On the other hand, the sharply defined memory cut-off can be accurately\nhandled with the mask assisted coarse graining (MACGIC-QUAPI) approach. Our\nfindings demonstrates that if system coupling operators to different baths do\nnot commute, the additive nature of the statistically independent environments\nmay be misleading.

In our benchmark, these\nproblems span four core mathematical fields, each including a verifiable\nnumerical solution to enable objective, rule-based evaluation. Empirical\nresults underscore the significant challenge presented by OlymMATH, with\nstate-of-the-art models including DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's o3-mini\ndemonstrating notably limited accuracy on the hard subset. Furthermore, the\nbenchmark facilitates comprehensive bilingual assessment of mathematical\nreasoning abilities-a critical dimension that remains largely unaddressed in\nmainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks. We release the OlymMATH benchmark\nat the STILL project: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Slow_Thinking_with_LLMs.", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21380v1", "topic": "mathematics", "published": "2025-03-27T11:20:17+00:00", "arxiv_id": "2503.21380v1"}

While this strategy has been tremendously\nsuccessful in physics and is typically considered the pinnacle of scientific\nformulation, it has often fallen short in addressing fundamental questions in\nthe biological sciences. This limitation arises from the inherent complexity of\nbiological systems, characterised by heterogeneity, poly-functionality and\ninteractions across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Nevertheless, the\ntraditional framework of complex systems modelling also falls short, as its\nemphasis on broad theoretical principles has often failed to produce realistic,\npredictive, empirically grounded insights. To advance towards the goal of\nactionable mathematical models in biology, we argue here, using neuroscience as\na case study, that it is necessary to move beyond simple reductionist\napproaches and instead embrace the intrinsic complexity and heterogeneity of\nbiological systems-leveraging the growing availability of high-resolution data\nand recent advances in high-performance computing. In particular, we advocate\nfor a holistic mathematical modelling paradigm that harnesses rich\nrepresentational structures such as annotated and multilayer networks, employs\nagent-based models and simulation-based approaches, and focuses on the inverse\nproblem of inferring system properties from dynamical observations.

One possible avenue to explore this boundary is to identify\nclasses of quantum circuits that can be efficiently simulated on a classical\ncomputer. Instead of simulating a general quantum circuit with a classical\ndevice, new schemes have recently emerged to simulate them on a quantum device\nthat is restricted in some manner. As such, these techniques allow us to study\nhow the restrictions impact the computational power of the device. One such\ntechnique is called quasiprobability simulation (QPS) and it estimates the\nresult of a quantum circuit with a Monte Carlo procedure that randomly replaces\ncircuit elements with ones that can be executed on the restricted quantum\ndevice.\n  The main focus of this thesis is dedicated to the QPS-based simulation of\nnonlocal quantum computation using local quantum operations. On the practical\nside, this enables the simulation of large quantum circuits using multiple\nsmaller quantum devices - a procedure that is sometimes called circuit\nknitting. We uncover a rich mathematical formalism with many connections to the\nresource theory of entanglement.

Here, we propose using\ncircularly polarized light to tune the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\ninteraction in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. Using the real-space\nretarded Green's functions approach, our results show that while the Heisenberg\nand Ising exchanges dominate, a notable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction\nalso plays a key role. Furthermore, the inherent strength of altermagnetism\nimprints chirp-like signatures into the magnetic responses, which can be\ndynamically tuned via light. We mainly demonstrate that gate-induced Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling is essential in response to light -- light selectively and\nanisotropically adjusts the DM interaction without affecting the other\nexchanges. Our findings further indicate that rotating the altermagnet by\n$45^\\circ$ relative to the light's polarization direction generates a\nDirac-like dispersion and different DM interactions.

Nevertheless, the applicability of the\nQUAPI method to realistic systems of interest is restricted by the\nexponentially growing computer memory requirements with respect to the size of\nthe quantum system and the time range of non-Markovian correlation effects.\nThis exponential ''wall'' becomes even more severe for multiple non-commuting\nfluctuating environments. In the present work, we address the numerical\nefficiency and accuracy of approximations that have been introduced for the\nQUAPI method with a single general environment, for the case of two independent\nnon-commuting environments where one of them is considered as a pure dephasing\nenvironment. Specifically, we consider a sharply defined cut-off of the memory\ntime, path filtering and mask assisted coarse graining of influence functional\ncoefficients (MACGIC-QUAPI) as approximations. We demonstrate that commonly\napplied numerical techniques such as path filtering cannot be straightforwardly\ntransferred to the two bath case even in the weak-coupling and quasi-Markovian\nlimits. On the other hand, the sharply defined memory cut-off can be accurately\nhandled with the mask assisted coarse graining (MACGIC-QUAPI) approach. Our\nfindings demonstrates that if system coupling operators to different baths do\nnot commute, the additive nature of the statistically independent environments\nmay be misleading.

Optical OAM was traditionally considered rare,\npredominantly manifesting during high-order atomic and molecular transitions.\nThe conceptual shift initiated by Allen et al. in 1992, which showed that laser\nbeams with optical vortex--characterized by their twisted wavefronts--naturally\ncarry intrinsic OAM, laid the groundwork for subsequent studies.

We consider two\nstraightforward calibration models, linear regression (LR) and non-homogeneous\nGaussian regression (NHGR), incorporating deterministic, control and ensemble\nmean forecast covariates. We show that relatively simple calibration models\n(with at most three covariates) provide good calibration and that addition of\nfurther covariates cannot be justified. Optimal calibration models (for the\nforecast mean of a physical quantity) always make use of the deterministic\nforecast and ensemble mean forecast for the same quantity, together with a\ncovariate associated with a different physical quantity. The selection of\noptimal covariates is performed independently per forecast horizon, and the set\nof optimal covariates shows a large degree of consistency across forecast\nhorizons. As a result, it is possible to specify a consistent model to\ncalibrate a given physical quantity, incorporating a common set of three\ncovariates for all horizons. For NHGR models of a given physical quantity, the\nensemble forecast standard deviation for that quantity is skilful in predicting\nforecast error standard deviation, strikingly so for Hs. We show that the\nconsistent LR and NHGR calibration models facilitate reduction in forecast bias\nto near zero for all of Hs, W and Tm, and that there is little difference\nbetween LR and NHGR calibration for the mean. Both LR and NHGR models\nfacilitate reduction in forecast error standard deviation relative to naive\nadoption of the (uncalibrated) deterministic forecast, with NHGR providing\nsomewhat better performance.", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21488v1", "topic": "physics", "published": "2025-03-27T13:24:16+00:00", "arxiv_id": "2503.21488v1"}

The proposed approach is based on\nEuler angles representing orientations of the crystals. Two pairs of the angles\nare directly related to two vectors normal to the boundary plane in the crystal\nreference frames, and the new boundary representation can be viewed as a\ntriplet composed of these vectors and the angle of rotation about the axis\nperpendicular to the plane. The representation resembles the `interface-plane\nscheme', but unlike the latter, it is a proper parameterization. Basic\npractical aspects of the parameterization (such as equivalences due to\nsymmetries, fundamental regions, uniform distribution of boundaries) are\nconsidered.

As in the\nclassical case [Girardi et al., arXiv:2503.18910], this definition allows for a\nclosed-form expression and has an operational interpretation as the asymptotic\nerror exponent in the hypothesis testing task of deciding whether a given\nbipartite state is product or not. We generalise the umlaut information to\nquantum channels, where it also extends the notion of `oveloh information'\n[Nuradha et al., arXiv:2404.16101]. We prove that channel umlaut information is\nadditive for classical-quantum channels, while we observe additivity violations\nfor fully quantum channels. Inspired by recent results in entanglement theory,\nwe then show as our main result that the regularised umlaut information\nconstitutes a fundamental measure of the quality of classical information\ntransmission over a quantum channel -- as opposed to the capacity, which\nquantifies the quantity of information that can be sent. This interpretation\napplies to coding assisted by activated non-signalling correlations, and the\nchannel umlaut information is in general larger than the corresponding\nexpression for unassisted communication as obtained by Dalai for the\nclassical-quantum case [IEEE Trans.

Solid Isotropic Material with\nPenalization (SIMP) is a Topology Optimization (TO) method offering a trade-off\nbetween minimum compliance (i.e., maximum stiffness) and a fixed material\namount for a given set of boundary conditions. Since TO is a non-convex\nproblem, its gradient can be tuned by filtering the topology's contour,\ncreating sharper material profiles without necessarily compromising optimality.\nHowever, despite simplifying the layout, some filters fail to address\nmanufacturability concerns such as capillarity (thin tweaks as struts)\ngenerated by uncertain loading, vibration or fatigue.\n  A tailored density-based filtering strategy is offered to tackle this issue.\nAdditionally, volume fraction is left unconstrained so material can be\nstrategically replenished through a logarithmic rule acting on the updated\ncompliance. In doing so, an interpolation space with three degrees of freedom\n(volume, compliance, minimum thickness) is created, yielding diverse topologies\nfor the same boundary conditions and design values along different stages of\nevolving topological families with distinct features.\n  The optimization process is further accelerated by introducing the\nvolume-compliance iterative scheme as a physical loss function in a Double\nDistance Neural Network (D$^2$NN), obtaining similar results to 2,000 steps\nworth of vanilla iteration within 500 training epochs.

Subsequently, these\nribosomal proteins enter the ribosome self-assembly process, synthesizing new\nribosomes and forming the well-known ribosome autocatalytic subcycle.\nNeglecting ribosome lifetime and the duration of the self-assembly process, the\ndoubling rate of all cellular biomass can be equated with the fraction of\nribosomes allocated to synthesize an essential ribosomal protein times its\nsynthesis rate. However, ribosomes have a finite lifetime, and the assembly\nprocess has a finite duration. Furthermore, the number of ribosomes is known to\ndecrease with slow growth rates. The finite lifetime of ribosomes and the\ndecline in their numbers present a challenge in sustaining slow growth solely\nthrough controlling the allocation of ribosomes to synthesize more ribosomal\nproteins. When the number of ribosomes allocated per mRNA of an essential\nribosomal protein is approximately one, the resulting fluctuations in the\nproduction rate of new ribosomes increase, causing a potential risk that the\nactual production rate will fall below the ribosome death rate. Thus, in this\nregime, a significant risk of extinction of the ribosome population emerges. To\nmitigate this risk, we suggest that the ribosome translation speed is used as\nan alternative control parameter, which facilitates the maintenance of slow\ngrowth rates with a larger ribosome pool.

Here, we present a novel framework to evaluate large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for zero-shot inference of causal relationships in\nbiology. In particular, we systematically evaluate causal claims obtained from\nan LLM using real-world interventional data. This is done over one hundred\nvariables and thousands of causal hypotheses. Furthermore, we consider several\nprompting and retrieval-augmentation strategies, including large, and\npotentially conflicting, collections of scientific articles. Our results show\nthat with tailored augmentation and prompting, even relatively small LLMs can\ncapture meaningful aspects of causal structure in biological systems. This\nsupports the notion that LLMs could act as orchestration tools in biological\ndiscovery, by helping to distil current knowledge in ways amenable to\ndownstream analysis. Our approach to assessing LLMs with respect to\nexperimental data is relevant for a broad range of problems at the intersection\nof causal learning, LLMs and scientific discovery.", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04347v1", "topic": "biology", "published": "2025-03-06T11:43:30+00:00", "arxiv_id": "2503.04347v1"}

One possible avenue to explore this boundary is to identify\nclasses of quantum circuits that can be efficiently simulated on a classical\ncomputer. Instead of simulating a general quantum circuit with a classical\ndevice, new schemes have recently emerged to simulate them on a quantum device\nthat is restricted in some manner. As such, these techniques allow us to study\nhow the restrictions impact the computational power of the device. One such\ntechnique is called quasiprobability simulation (QPS) and it estimates the\nresult of a quantum circuit with a Monte Carlo procedure that randomly replaces\ncircuit elements with ones that can be executed on the restricted quantum\ndevice.\n  The main focus of this thesis is dedicated to the QPS-based simulation of\nnonlocal quantum computation using local quantum operations. On the practical\nside, this enables the simulation of large quantum circuits using multiple\nsmaller quantum devices - a procedure that is sometimes called circuit\nknitting. We uncover a rich mathematical formalism with many connections to the\nresource theory of entanglement.

Current navigation models predominantly address interactions with\nindividual pedestrians while failing to account for human groups that naturally\nform in real-world settings. Conversely, the limited models implementing\ngroup-aware navigation typically prioritize group dynamics at the expense of\nindividual interactions, both of which are essential for socially appropriate\nnavigation. This research extends an existing simulation framework to\nincorporate both individual pedestrians and human groups. We present Tangent\nAction for Group Avoidance (TAGA), a modular reactive mechanism that can be\nintegrated with existing navigation frameworks to enhance their group-awareness\ncapabilities. TAGA dynamically modifies robot trajectories using tangent\naction-based avoidance strategies while preserving the underlying model's\ncapacity to navigate around individuals. Additionally, we introduce Group\nCollision Rate (GCR), a novel metric to quantitatively assess how effectively\nrobots maintain group integrity during navigation. Through comprehensive\nsimulation-based benchmarking, we demonstrate that integrating TAGA with\nstate-of-the-art navigation models (ORCA, Social Force, DS-RNN, and AG-RL)\nreduces group intrusions by 45.7-78.6% while maintaining comparable success\nrates and navigation efficiency.
